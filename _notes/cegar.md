title: CEGAR (Counter-Example Guided Abstraction Refinement)
---

Counter-Example Guided Abstraction Refinement is a method of constructing
an abstraction of a system such as a program by constructing a series
of increasingly precise abstractions, attempting to verify the system
using those abstractions and, if an attempt fails, using a counter-example
from the failed attempt to construct a more precise abstraction.

I think the original paper was <https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/10722167_15>.
