title: Permission accounting
---

A generalization of the notion of [fractional permissions]
for tracking the ownership of shared resources and, in
particular, to track when a resource goes back to having a single
owner.

Includes fractional permissions and permission counting.

Adapted for [separation logic] by [bornat:popl:2005].
Later, [heule:ftfjp:2011] developed a variation that avoids the sometimes ad hoc
choice of what fractions to use.
