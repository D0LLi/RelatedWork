title: Search based test generation
notes:
- fuzz testing
- symbolic execution

Generation of program tests using search techniques.

Contrast with [fuzz testing] and [symbolic execution] (although the
different communities seem to have started talking so expect
hybrid approaches).

One common approach uses genetic algorithms and related techniques
and requires definition of a fitness function to guide the search.
