An interactive theorem prover (aka "proof assistant")
is an interactive tool for finding and checking proofs.
The search is normally controlled by human provided "tactics".

Some theorem provers follow the "LCF" theorem prover in
generating a proof certificate that is checked by a small
trusted core.
Some variants optimize this process while preserving the
same soundness guarantee.
