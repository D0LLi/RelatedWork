Contract based development (aka Contract driven development)
is a development methodology where you write a contract for a function/method/class
before implementing it.
Name comes from Bertrand Meyer's paper [meyer:fase:2007].

In a formal verification context, this is often synonymous with [modular verification].

The approach of defining the desired behaviour before implementing the
behaviour bears some resemblance to [test driven development].
