BLAST (Berkeley Lazy Abstraction Software verification Tool)
was an early C program verification tool.

> The task addressed by BLAST is the need to check whether software satisfies the
> behavioral requirements of its associated interfaces. BLAST employs
> counterexample-driven automatic abstraction refinement to construct an abstract
> model that is then model-checked for safety properties. The abstraction is
> constructed on the fly, and only to the requested precision.
