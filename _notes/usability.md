Some techniques used in usability research

- [Friction diagram]
  Plot of activity against time that highlights deviations from the
  primary activity.

- [Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale)
  is a questionnaire entry that asks you to respond on a symmetric scale
  of subjective responses along the lines of "strongly disagree" through
  to "strongly agree".


- [Snowball sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_sampling)
  is finding participants by starting with a small seed
  of participants and using them to find some more participants.
  Keep going until you have enough.
  Typically used with hidden populations such as drug addicts.

- [Open coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_coding)
  is deciding which features of an interview (say) are
  significant based on sampling a few interviews. Then using the resulting set
  of codes for the remainder.
  (But the Wikipedia link says something a little different.)
