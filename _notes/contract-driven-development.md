Contract driven development is a development methodology where you write
a contract for a function/method/class before implementing it.

The name comes from Bertrand Meyer's paper [meyer:fase:2007].

In a formal verification context, this is often synonymous with [modular
verification].

The approach of defining the desired behaviour before implementing the
behaviour bears some resemblance to [test driven development].
