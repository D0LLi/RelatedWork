todo:

A good summary of SMT from [baldoni:compsurv:2018] is

> Observe that some problems are more naturally described with languages that are
> more expressive than the one of boolean formulas with logical connectives.
> For this reason, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) generalize the SAT
> problem with supporting theories to capture formulas involving, for instance,
> linear arithmetic and operations over arrays.
> SMT solvers map the atoms in an SMT formula to fresh boolean variables: a SAT
> decision procedure checks the rewritten formula for satisfiability, and
> a theory solver checks the model generated by the SAT procedure.

[SMT-COMP website] is very significant and probably a good way to find SMT
solvers and to select one or two to consider for a new project.

And Vampire, that is a theorem prover pretending to be an SMT solver?

## Testing of SMT solvers

[brummayer:sat:2010] and [mansur:arxiv:2020] tested SMT solvers and found bugs.
There are several proposals such as [stump:fmsd:2013] and [barrett:mlf:2015]
for a proof format that would allow SMT proofs to be checked.
