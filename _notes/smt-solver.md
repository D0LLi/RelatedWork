[SMT-COMP website] is very significant and probably a good way to find SMT
solvers and to select one or two to consider for a new project.

## List of major solvers

- <https://cvc4.github.io>
- [Z3 solver]
- <https://yices.csl.sri.com>
- <https://stp.github.io>

- <https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/smtinterpol/>

And Vampire, that is a theorem prover pretending to be an SMT solver?

## Testing of SMT solvers

todo: at least two papers about testing SMT solvers and that found bugs.
