How easy it is to test a piece of software.

The wikipedia page lists the following features as important: Controllability,
Observability, Isolateability, Separation of concerns, Understandability,
Automatability, and Heterogeneity.

- [Writing fuzzable code (John Regehr)](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687)
- [Test driven development] is based on testing every change to the code so
  advice about how to do TDD often describes how to make code more testable.
