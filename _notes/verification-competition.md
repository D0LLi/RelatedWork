title: Verification tool competition
---

Competitions for (automatic) verification tools compare tools against a common
set of benchmarks and typically compare results based on how many of the
benchmarks can be verified within a given time.  The need to have a common
input/output language and the creation of a growing set of benchmarks helps
drive a research area forward.

(There are also competitions for [auto-active verification] tools and
interactive verification tools but these also test the expertise of the humans
driving the tools.)
