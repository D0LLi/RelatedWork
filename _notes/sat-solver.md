SAT solvers are tools that solve the "Boolean satisfiability problem"
([malik:cacm:2009]): finding a set of boolean variable values such that
a boolean formula is true.

SAT is used to reason about hardware, to encode other problems (e.g., graph
problems, etc.), in [model checking], in [SMT solver]s and in many other
applications.
