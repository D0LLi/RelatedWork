Separation logic is an extension of [Hoare
logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic)
that adds the
ability to reason about heap-based data structures and,
in particular, about aliasing.
It does this using ideas from linear logic to model
resources that cannot be duplicated.

Variations on the theme of separation logic have been developed
and are collectively referred to as [permission logic].
