title: Intermediate verification language
---

An intermediate verification language is a simple verification language that
more complex languages can be converted down to.

A critical feature in IVLs is that any error messages can be converted back
to the source language as in the [Boogie verification debugger].

Examples include
[Boogie] and
[Viper].

[Viper]: {{ "notes/viper-verifier" | relative_url }}
