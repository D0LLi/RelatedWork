An intermediate verification language is a simple verification language that
more complex languages can be converted down to.

A critical feature in IVLs is that any error messages can be converted back
to the source language as in the [Boogie verification debugger][legoues:sefm:2011].

Examples include
the [Boogie verifier] and
the [Viper verifier].
