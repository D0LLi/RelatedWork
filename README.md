This site contains short sketches of papers related to what I am working on or thinking about.

The goal is to create a mini-survey of work in whatever area.  Probably not comprehensive, certainly skewed by whatever my interest in a field may be and probably flawed by the fact that I am typically an outsider/newcomer to the field struggling to make sense of what I am reading and to find the important papers in a sea of publications.

I am not yet sure where I am going with this. Will I have the courage to make this public? Will I invite corrections, contributions, pull requests?  Or will I keep it private (or, at least, unpublicised) and have it be just for my own personal use?

One thing I am thinking of doing is commenting on which papers have good surveys of the field.  This may be hard though since it risks being affected by whether it tells me something new and therefore by the order that I read papers.

It would be good to add doi and orchid for all papers and authors and to be able to click on each author to see what else they wrote.  But this makes it sound like I want an overlay over Google Scholar - is there a reasonable way to do that so that I get all the information out of GS (authors, #cites,  related, cited by, references)?
