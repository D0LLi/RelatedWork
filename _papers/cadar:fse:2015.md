abstract: Semantics-preserving program transformations, such as refactorings and optimisations, can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of symbolic
  execution testing and analysis. Furthermore, semantics-preserving transformations that increase the performance of native execution can in fact decrease
  the scalability of symbolic execution. Similarly, semantics-altering transformations, such as type changes and object size modifications, can often lead
  to substantial improvements in the testing effectiveness achieved by symbolic execution in the original program. As a result, we argue that one should
  treat program transformations as first-class ingredients of scalable symbolic execution, alongside widely-accepted aspects such as search heuristics and
  constraint solving optimisations. First, we propose to understand the impact of existing program transformations on symbolic execution, to increase scalability
  and improve experimental design and reproducibility. Second, we argue for the design of testability transformations specifically targeted toward more
  scalable symbolic execution.
