abstract: Because of poor tools, developing embedded systems can be unnecessarily hard. Machine descriptions based on register-transfer lists (RTLs) have
  proven useful in building retargetable compilers, but not in building other retargetable tools. Simulators, assemblers, linkers, debuggers, and profilers
  are built by hand if at all--previous machine descriptions have lacked the detail and precision needed to generate them. This paper presents detailed
  and precise machine-description techniques that are based on a new formalization of RTLs. Unlike previous notations, these RTLs have a detailed, unambiguous,
  and machine-independent semantics, which makes them ideal for supporting automatic generation of retargetable tools. The paper also gives examples of
  \textdollar {\l}ambda\textdollar -RTL, a notation that makes it possible for human beings to read and write RTLs without becoming overwhelmed by machine-dependent
  detail.
