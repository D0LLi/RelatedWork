abstract: 'Linear type systems permit programmers to deallocate or explicitly recycle
  memory, but are severely restricted by the fact that they admit no aliasing. This
  paper describes a pseudo-linear type system that allows a degree of aliasing and
  memory reuse as well as the ability to define complex recursive data structures.
  Our type system can encode conventional linear data structures such as linear lists
  and trees as well as more sophisticated data structures including cyclic and doubly-linked
  lists and trees. In the latter cases, our type system is expressive enough to represent
  pointer aliasing and yet safely permit destructive operations such as object deallocation.We
  demonstrate the flexibility of our type system by encoding two common space-conscious
  algorithms: destination-passing style and Deutsch-Schorr-Waite or \textasciigrave
  \textasciigrave link-reversal\textquotesingle \textquotesingle  traversal algorithms.'
