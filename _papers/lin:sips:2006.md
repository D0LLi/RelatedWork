abstract: Software Defined Radio(SDR) is an emerging paradigm for wireless terminals, in which the physical layer of communication protocols is implemented
  in software rather than by ASICs. Many of the current and next generation wireless protocols include Turbo coding because of its superior performance.
  However, Turbo decoding is computationally intensive, and its low power implementations have typ- ically been in ASICs. This paper presents a case study
  of algorithm-architecture co-design of Turbo decoder for SDR. We present a programmable DSP architecture for SDR that includes a set of architectural
  features to accelerate Turbo decoder computations. We then present a parallel window scheduling for MAX-Log-MAP component decoder that matches well with
  the DSP architecture. Finally, we present a software implementation of Turbo decoder for W-CDMA on the DSP architecture and show that it achieves 2Mbps
  decoding throughput.
