abstract: Advancement of AI-enhanced control in autonomous systems stands on the shoulders of formal methods, which make possible the rigorous safety analysis
  autonomous systems require. An aircraft cannot operate autonomously unless it has design-time reasoning to ensure correct operation of the autopilot and
  runtime reasoning to ensure system health management, or the ability to detect and respond to off-nominal situations. Formal methods are highly dependent
  on the specifications over which they reason; there is no escaping the ``garbage in, garbage out'' reality. Specification is difficult, unglamorous, and
  arguably the biggest bottleneck facing verification and validation of aerospace, and other, autonomous systems.
