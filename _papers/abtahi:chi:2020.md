abstract: Experienced programmers are capable of learning new programming languages independently using various available resources, but we lack a comprehensive
  understanding of which resources they find most valuable in doing so. In this paper, we study how experienced programmers learn Rust, a systems programming
  language with extensive documentation and example code, an active online community, and descriptive compiler errors. We develop a task that requires learning
  Rust syntax and comprehending the Rust-specific approach to mutability and ownership. Our results show that users spend 43\% of online time viewing example
  code and that programmers appreciate in-line compiler errors, choosing to refresh, on average, every 30.6 seconds after first discovering this feature.
  The average time between these refreshes predicted total task time, but individual resource choices did not. Based on our findings we offer design implications
  for language and IDE developers.
