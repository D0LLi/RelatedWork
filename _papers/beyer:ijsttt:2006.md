abstract: In the verified architecture microprocessor (VAMP) project we have designed, functionally verified, and synthesized a processor with full DLX
  instruction set, delayed branch, Tomasulo scheduler, maskable nested precise interrupts, pipelined fully IEEE compatible dual precision floating point
  unit with variable latency, and separate instruction and data caches. The verification has been carried out in the theorem proving system PVS. The processor
  has been implemented on a Xilinx FPGA.
