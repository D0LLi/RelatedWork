abstract: Scaling symbolic execution to large programs or programs with complex inputs remains difficult due to path explosion and complex constraints,
  as well as external method calls. Additionally, creating an effective test structure with symbolic inputs can be difficult. A popular symbolic execution
  strategy in practice is to perform symbolic execution not "from scratch" but based on existing test cases. This paper proposes that the effectiveness
  of this approach to symbolic execution can be enhanced by (1) reducing the size of seed test cases and (2) prioritizing seed test cases to maximize exploration
  efficiency. The proposed test case reduction strategy is based on a recently introduced generalization of delta debugging, and our prioritization techniques
  include novel methods that, for this purpose, can outperform some traditional regression testing algorithms. We show that applying these methods can significantly
  improve the effectiveness of symbolic execution based on existing test cases.
