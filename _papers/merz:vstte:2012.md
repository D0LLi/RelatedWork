abstract: Bounded model checking (BMC) of C and C++ programs is challenging due to
  the complex and intricate syntax and semantics of these programming languages. The
  BMC tool LLBMC presented in this paper thus uses the LLVM compiler framework in
  order to translate C and C++ programs into LLVM\textquotesingle s intermediate representation.
  The resulting code is then converted into a logical representation and simplified
  using rewrite rules. The simplified formula is finally passed to an SMT solver.
  In contrast to many other tools, LLBMC uses a flat, bit-precise memory model. It
  can thus precisely model, e.g., memory-based re-interpret casts as used in C and
  static/dynamic casts as used in C++. An empirical evaluation shows that LLBMC compares
  favorable to the related BMC tools CBMC and ESBMC.
