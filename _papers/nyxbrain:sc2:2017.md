Written as an encouragement to the computer algebra community to create
a [verification competition].  It explains why [verification competition]s are
designed the way they are.  It also has an analysis of how improving time to
solve affects scores where improvements might be shaving a second off the time,
adding parallelism, random variations in time, etc.
