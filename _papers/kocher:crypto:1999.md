abstract: Cryptosystem designers frequently assume that secrets will be manipulated in closed, reliable computing environments. Unfortunately, actual computers
  and microchips leak information about the operations they process. This paper examines specific methods for analyzing power consumption measurements to
  find secret keys from tamper resistant devices. We also discuss approaches for building cryptosystems that can operate securely in existing hardware that
  leaks information.
