abstract: This rough diamond presents a new domain-specific language (DSL) for producing detailed models of Instruction Set Architectures, such as ARM and
  x86. The language's design and methodology is discussed and we propose future plans for this work. Feedback is sought from the wider theorem proving community
  in helping establish future directions for this project. A parser and interpreter for the DSL has been developed in Standard ML, with an ARMv7 model used
  as a case study.
