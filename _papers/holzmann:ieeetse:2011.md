abstract: The range of verification problems that can be solved with logic model checking tools has increased significantly in the last few decades. This
  increase in capability is based on algorithmic advances and new theoretical insights, but it has also benefitted from the steady increase in processing
  speeds and main memory sizes on standard computers. The steady increase in processing speeds, though, ended when chip-makers started redirecting their
  efforts to the development of multicore systems. For the near-term future, we can anticipate the appearance of systems with large numbers of CPU cores,
  but without matching increases in clock-speeds. We will describe a model checking strategy that can allow us to leverage this trend and that allows us
  to tackle significantly larger problem sizes than before.
