SMACK translates LLVM bitcode files to the [Boogie language]
(an [intermediate verification language])
allowing it to support any language that LLVM supports (mostly C/C++ in this
paper).

SMACK implements one key optimization: using alias analysis to partition the
heap (and pointers into the heap) so that objects that could not be confused
are in separate sub-heaps.
