year: 2014
topics:

SMACK translates LLVM bitcode files to the
[Boogie]({{ "papers/barnett:fmco:2005" | relative_url }})
Intermediate Verification Language (IVL)
allowing it to support any language that LLVM supports (mostly C/C++ in this
paper).

Smack implements one key optimization: using alias analysis to partition the
heap (and pointers into the heap) so that objects that could not be confused
are in separate sub-heaps.
