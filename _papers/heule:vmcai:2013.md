abstract: 'Fractional Permissions are a popular approach to reasoning about programs
  that use shared-memory concurrency, because they provide a way of proving data race
  freedom while permitting concurrent read access. However, specification using fractional
  permissions typically requires the user to pick concrete mathematical values for
  partial permissions, making specifications overly low-level, tedious to write, and
  harder to adapt and re-use. This paper introduces abstract read permissions: a flexible
  and expressive specification methodology that supports fractional permissions while
  allowing the user to work at the abstract level of read and write permissions. The
  methodology is flexible, modular, and sound. It has been implemented in the verification
  tool Chalice.'
