abstract: 'Dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) is a well-known technique for automatically generating tests to achieve higher levels of coverage in a program.
  Two keys ideas of DSE are to: (1) seed symbolic execution by executing a program on an initial input; (2) using concrete values from the program execution
  in place of symbolic expressions whenever symbolic reasoning is hard or not desired. We describe DSE for a simple core language and then present a minimalist
  implementation of DSE for Python (in Python) that follows this basic recipe. The code is available at https://www.github.com/thomasjball/PyExZ3/ (tagged
  v1.0) and has been designed to make it easy to experiment with and extend.'
