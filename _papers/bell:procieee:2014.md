abstract: During the 1960s a new class of low-cost computers evolved, which, combined with a growing number of individuals programming and using them, led
  to wide-ranging innovations that helped to stimulate decades of growth of the entire computer industry. Sold as components to original equipment manufacturers,
  classic minicomputers provided the opportunity for businesses to create new solutions for process control, manufacturing, engineering design, scientific
  experiments, communication systems, and many more.

This describes the history of minicomputers from the late '50s through to the '80s.
One of the things I found fascinating (because I had not heard it before) is
that many minicomputers were sold to OEMs who incorporated the minis into
products where they were used for industrial control and things like that.
The paper argues that we should distinguish these "classic minicomputers"
from minicomputers that are defined more by their price relative to mainframes.
