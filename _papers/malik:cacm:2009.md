This paper is a great intro/overview of SAT solving: what it is, why it is (NP)
hard, how SAT solvers work, the role of benchmarks and competitions, the
massive performance improvements in the 10 years prior to it being published
and the industrial impact.

Worth reading in conjunction with the SMT intro/overview in
[demoura:cacm:2011].
