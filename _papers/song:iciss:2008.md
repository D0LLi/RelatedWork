abstract: In this paper, we give an overview of the BitBlaze project, a new approach to computer security via binary analysis. In particular, BitBlaze focuses
  on building a unified binary analysis platform and using it to provide novel solutions to a broad spectrum of different security problems. The binary
  analysis platform is designed to enable accurate analysis, provide an extensible architecture, and combines static and dynamic analysis as well as program
  verification techniques to satisfy the common needs of security applications. By extracting security-related properties from binary programs directly,
  BitBlaze enables a principled, root-cause based approach to computer security, offering novel and effective solutions, as demonstrated with over a dozen
  different security applications.
