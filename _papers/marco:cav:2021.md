abstract: Most existing program verifiers check trace properties such as functional correctness, but do not support the verification of hyperproperties,
  in particular, information flow security. In principle, product programs allow one to reduce the verification of hyperproperties to trace properties and,
  thus, apply standard verifiers to check them; in practice, product constructions are usually defined only for simple programming languages without features
  like dynamic method binding or concurrency and, consequently, cannot be directly applied to verify information flow security in a full-fledged language.
  However, many existing verifiers encode programs from source languages into simple intermediate verification languages, which opens up the possibility
  of constructing a product program on the intermediate language level, reusing the existing encoding and drastically reducing the effort required to develop
  new verification tools for information flow security.
