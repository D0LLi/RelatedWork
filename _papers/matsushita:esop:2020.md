abstract: Reduction to the satisfiablility problem for constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) is a widely studied approach to automated program verification. The
  current CHC-based methods for pointer-manipulating programs, however, are not very scalable. This paper proposes a novel translation of pointer-manipulating
  Rust programs into CHCs, which clears away pointers and heaps by leveraging ownership. We formalize the translation for a simplified core of Rust and
  prove its correctness. We have implemented a prototype verifier for a subset of Rust and confirmed the effectiveness of our method.
