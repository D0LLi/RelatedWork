This paper tackles three problems:

- Supporting user-defined predicates in separation logic,
  adding OPEN and CLOSE rules to unfold and fold
  their definitions.

- Placing restrictions on where OPEN/CLOSE can be used
  in order to enforce data abstractions.

- Generalizing abstract predicates to support object-oriented
  languages by adding abstract predicate families that can be
  indexed by the class.

There are a number of examples manually proved in this paper.
