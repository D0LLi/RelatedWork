abstract: Computing relies on architecture specifications to decouple hardware and software development. Historically these have been prose documents, with
  all the problems that entails, but research over the last ten years has developed rigorous and executable-as-test-oracle specifications of mainstream
  architecture instruction sets and ``user-mode'' concurrency, clarifying architectures and bringing them into the scope of programming-language semantics
  and verification. However, the system semantics, of instruction-fetch and cache maintenance, exceptions and interrupts, and address translation, remains
  obscure, leaving us without a solid foundation for verification of security-critical systems software.
