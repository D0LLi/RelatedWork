abstract: Using static analysis tools for automating code inspections can be beneficial for software engineers. Such tools can make finding bugs, or software
  defects, faster and cheaper than manual inspections. Despite the benefits of using static analysis tools to find bugs, research suggests that these tools
  are underused. In this paper, we investigate why developers are not widely using static analysis tools and how current tools could potentially be improved.
  We conducted interviews with 20 developers and found that although all of our participants felt that use is beneficial, false positives and the way in
  which the warnings are presented, among other things, are barriers to use. We discuss several implications of these results, such as the need for an interactive
  mechanism to help developers fix defects.
