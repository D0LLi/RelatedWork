abstract: Consider a sequential programming language with control flow constructs
  such as assignments, choice, loops, and procedure calls. We restrict the syntax
  of expressions in this language to one that can be efficiently decided by a satisfiability-modulo-theories
  solver. For such a language, we define the problem of deciding whether a program
  can reach a particular control location as the reachability-modulo-theories problem.
  This paper describes the architecture of Corral, a semi-algorithm for the reachability-modulo-theories
  problem. Corraluses novel algorithms for inlining procedures on demand (Stratified
  Inlining) and abstraction refinement (Hierarchical Refinement). The paper also presents
  an evaluation of Corralagainst other related tools. Corralconsistently outperforms
  its competitors on most benchmarks.
