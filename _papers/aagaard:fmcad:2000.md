abstract: We present a formal verification methodology for datapathdominated hardware. This provides a systematic but flexible framework within which to
  organize the activities undertaken in large-scale verification efforts and to structure the associated code and proof-script artifacts. The methodology
  deploys a combination of model checking and lightweight theorem proving in higher-order logic, tightly integrated within a general-purpose functional
  programming language that allows the framework to be easily customized and also serves as a specification language. We illustrate the methodology-which
  has has proved highly effective in large-scale industrial trials-with the verification of an IEEE- compliant, extended precision floating-point adder.
