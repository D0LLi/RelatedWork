abstract: The fourth version of the DIVINE model checker provides a modular platform for verification of real-world programs. It is built around an efficient
  interpreter of LLVM code which, together with a small, verification-oriented operating system and a set of runtime libraries, enables verification of
  code written in C and C++.
