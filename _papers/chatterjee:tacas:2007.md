abstract: Reasoning about heap-allocated data structures such as linked lists and
  arrays is challenging. The reachability predicate has proved to be useful for reasoning
  about the heap in type-safe languages where memory is manipulated by dereferencing
  object fields. Sound and precise analysis for such data structures becomes significantly
  more challenging in the presence of low-level pointer manipulation that is prevalent
  in systems software.
