abstract: Presenting large formal instruction set models as executable functions makes them accessible to engineers and useful for less formal purposes
  such as simulation. However, it is more difficult to extract information about the behaviour of individual instructions for reasoning. We present a method
  which combines symbolic evaluation and symbolic execution techniques to provide a rule-based view of instruction behaviour, with particular application
  to automatic test generation for large MIPS-like models.
