abstract: We describe a sound method for automatically proving Hoare triples for loop-free
  code in Separation Logic, for certain preconditions and postconditions (symbolic
  heaps). The method uses a form of symbolic execution, a decidable proof theory for
  symbolic heaps, and extraction of frame axioms from incomplete proofs. This is a
  precursor to the use of the logic in automatic specification checking, program analysis,
  and model checking.
