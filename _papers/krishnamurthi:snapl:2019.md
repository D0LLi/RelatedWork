title: 'The next 700 semantics: A research challenge'
year: 2019

As a step towards making it easier to construct a semantics
for all the languages found in the wild, this paper considers
the common practice of having a small(ish) core language and
a set of desugarings from the surface language.

The problem they tackle is learning the desugarings.
They try four different approaches:
na√Øve tree matching;
learning a tree transducer by Gibbs sampling;
genetic programming;
and
synthesis.
While none of these actually succeed, they
have a detailed analysis of why each fails.
