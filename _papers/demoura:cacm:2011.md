This paper is a great intro/overview of [SMT solver]: what it is, how it builds
on SAT, an example of how one particular theory (difference arithmetic) is
implemented, and the many applications of SMT solvers in program analysis,
program verification, etc.

Worth reading in conjunction with the [SAT solver] intro/overview in
[malik:cacm:2009],
