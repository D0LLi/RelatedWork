abstract: The Boogie Verification Debugger (BVD) is a tool that lets users explore
  the potential program errors reported by a deductive program verifier. The user
  interface is like that of a dynamic debugger, but the debugging happens statically
  without executing the program. BVD integrates with the program-verification engine
  Boogie. Just as Boogie supports multiple language front-ends, BVD can work with
  those front-ends through a plug-in architecture. BVD plugins have been implemented
  for two state-of-the-art verifiers, VCC and Dafny.
