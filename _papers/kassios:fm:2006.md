abstract: This paper addresses the frame problem for programming theories that support
  both sharing and encapsulation through specification variables. The concept of dynamic
  frames is introduced. It is shown how a programming theory with dynamic frames supports
  both features, without the use of alias control or any other kind of restriction.
  In contrast, other approaches introduce a number of restrictions to the programs
  to ensure soundness.
