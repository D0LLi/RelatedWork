abstract: A module system ought to enable assembly-line programming using separate compilation and an expressive linking language. Separate compilation
  allows programmers to develop parts of a program independently. A linking language gives programmers precise control over the assembly of parts into a
  whole. This paper presents models of program units, MzScheme's module language for assembly-line programming. Units support separate compilation, independent
  module reuse, cyclic dependencies, hierarchical structuring, and dynamic linking. The models explain how to integrate units with untyped and typed languages
  such as Scheme and ML.
