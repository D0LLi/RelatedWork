abstract: 'Software and hardware are increasingly being formally verified against specifications, but how can we verify the specifications themselves? This
  talk explores what it means to formally verify a specification. We solve three challenges: (1) How to create a secondary, higher-level specification that
  can be effectively reviewed by processor designers who are not experts in formal verification; (2) How to avoid common-mode failures between the specifications;
  and (3) How to automatically verify the two specifications against each other.  One of the most important specifications for software verification is
  the processor specification since it de nes the behaviour of machine code and of hardware protection features used by operating systems. We demonstrate
  our approach on ARM''s v8-M Processor Specification, which is intended to improve the security of Internet of Things devices. Thus, we focus on establishing
  the security guarantees the architecture is intended to provide. Despite the fact that the ARM v8-M specification had previously been extensively tested,
  we found twelve bugs (including two security bugs) that have all been fixed by ARM.'
