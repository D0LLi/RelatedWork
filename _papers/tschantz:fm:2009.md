abstract: 'Privacy means something different to everyone. Against a vast and rich canvas of diverse types of privacy rights and violations, we argue technology''s
  dual role in privacy: new technologies raise new threats to privacy rights and new technologies can help preserve privacy. Formal methods, as just one
  class of technology, can be applied to privacy, but privacy raises new challenges, and thus new research opportunities, for the formal methods community.'
