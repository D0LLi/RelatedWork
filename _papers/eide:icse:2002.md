abstract: 'Design patterns are a valuable mechanism for emphasizing structure, capturing design expertise, and facilitating restructuring of software systems.
  Patterns are typically applied in the context of an object-oriented language and are implemented so that the pattern participants correspond to object
  instances that are created and connected at run-time. This paper describes a complementary realization of design patterns, in which many pattern participants
  correspond to statically instantiated and connected components.Our approach separates the static parts of the software design from the dynamic parts of
  the system behavior. This separation makes the software design more amenable to analysis, thus enabling more effective and domain-specific detection of
  system design errors, prediction of run-time behavior, and more effective optimization. This technique is applicable to imperative, functional, and object-oriented
  languages: we have extended C, Scheme, and Java with our component model. In this paper, we illustrate our approach in the context of the OSKit, a collection
  of operating system components written in C.'
