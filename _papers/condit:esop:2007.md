abstract: In this paper, we describe the key principles of a dependent type system for low-level imperative languages. The major contributions of this work
  are (1) a sound type system that combines dependent types and mutation for variables and for heap-allocated structures in a more flexible way than before
  and (2) a technique for automatically inferring dependent types for local variables. We have applied these general principles to design Deputy, a dependent
  type system for C that allows the user to describe bounded pointers and tagged unions. Deputy has been used to annotate and check a number of real-world
  C programs.
