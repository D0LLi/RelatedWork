abstract: The Spec\# programming system [4] is a new attempt to increase the quality
  of general purpose, industrial software. Using old wisdom, we propose the use of
  specifications to make programmer assumptions explicit. Using modern technology,
  we propose the use of tools to enforce the specifications. To increase its chances
  of having impact, we want to design the system so that it can be widely adopted.
