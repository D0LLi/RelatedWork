abstract: Architecture specifications such as Armv8-A and RISC-V are the ultimate foundation for software verification and the correctness criteria for
  hardware verification. They should define the allowed sequential and relaxed-memory concurrency behaviour of programs, but hitherto there has been no
  integration of full-scale instruction-set architecture (ISA) semantics with axiomatic concurrency models, either in mathematics or in tools. These ISA
  semantics can be surprisingly large and intricate, e.g. 100k+ lines for Armv8-A.
