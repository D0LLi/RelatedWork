abstract: This paper presents an analysis of noninterference specifications used in a range of formally verified systems. The main findings are that these
  systems use distinct specifications and that they often employ small variations, both complicating their security implications. We categorize these specifications
  and discuss their trade-offs for reasoning about information flows in systems.
