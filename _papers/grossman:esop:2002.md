abstract: We integrate existential types into a strongly typed C-like language. In
  particular, we show how a bad combination of existential types, mutation, and aliasing
  can cause a subtle violation of type safety. We explore two independent ways to
  strengthen the type system to restore safety. One restricts the mutation of existential
  packages. The other restricts the types of aliases of existential packages. We use
  our framework to explain why other languages with existential types are safe.
