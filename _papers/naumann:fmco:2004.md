abstract: In object-oriented programming, reentrant method invocations and shared
  references make it difficult to achieve adequate encapsulation for sound modular
  reasoning. This tutorial paper surveys recent progress using auxiliary state (ghost
  fields) to describe and achieve encapsulation. Encapsulation is assessed in terms
  of modular reasoning about invariants and simulations.
