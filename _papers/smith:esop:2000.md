abstract: Linear type systems allow destructive operations such as object deallocation
  and imperative updates of functional data structures. These operations and others,
  such as the ability to reuse memory at different types, are essential in low-level
  typed languages. However, traditional linear type systems are too restrictive for
  use in low-level code where it is necessary to exploit pointer aliasing. We present
  a new typed language that allows functions to specify the shape of the store that
  they expect and to track the flow of pointers through a computation. Our type system
  is expressive enough to represent pointer aliasing and yet safely permit destructive
  operations.
