abstract: In recent years, hardware Trojans have drawn the attention of governments and industry as well as the scientific community. One of the main concerns
  is that integrated circuits, e.g., for military or critical-infrastructure applications, could be maliciously manipulated during the manufacturing process,
  which often takes place abroad. However, since there have been no reported hardware Trojans in practice yet, little is known about how such a Trojan would
  look like, and how difficult it would be in practice to implement one.
