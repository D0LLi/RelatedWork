abstract: We introduce a segment-offset-plane memory model for symbolic execution that supports symbolic pointers, allocations of memory blocks of symbolic
  sizes, and multi-writes. We further describe our efficient implementation of the model in a free open-source project Bugst. Experimental results provide
  empirical evidence that the implemented memory model effectively tackles the variable storage-referencing problem of symbolic execution.
