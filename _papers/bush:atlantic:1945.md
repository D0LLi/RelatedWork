This frequently referred to
[article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think)  was published just
after the end of the 2nd World War by [Vannevar
Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) (the Director of the Office
of Scientific Research and Development).  It is a swords-to-ploughshares best
known for the [Memex concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) that
influenced creators of hypertext, etc.

In an article this old, it is hard to know whether to call the ideas in
this article  "predictions", "inventions", "assumptions" or what.
Whatever they are, some of the ideas are

- Cameras will get smaller, wet photography will give way to dry
  photography (this sounds like Polaroid), and that will give way to
  electronic cameras.

- Data storage on microfilm will enable the Encyclopedia Brittanica to
  fit in a matchbox, cost a nickel and be mailed anywhere for one cent.

- The data for future encyclopedias will be entered using voice
  recognition and in head-mounted cameras (this sounds like Google
  Glass) that you can use hands-free as you do your work.

- Arithmetic machines (computers) will get very fast and be capable of
  calculus and symbolic logic.

  > Formal logic used to be a keen instrument in the hands of the
  > teacher in his trying of students' souls.

- Data retrieval (from the large microfilm store), using voice
  recognition.

- The memex: a personal computer with a large memory, screens, scanners
  that can exchange data with other memexes.

  > A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books,
  > records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may
  > be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged
  > intimate supplement to his memory.
  >
  > It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from
  > a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he
  > works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, on which
  > material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a
  > keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks like an
  > ordinary desk.
  >
  > ... And there is provision for direct entry. On the top of the memex
  > is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes,
  > photographs, memoranda, all sorts of things. When one is in place,
  > the depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next
  > blank space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being
  > employed.

- Bidirectional links between data items that form annotated "trails",
  and profesional "trail blazers" who hunt through data sources creating
  trails. (Trails are also created by individuals, physicians,
  historians, etc.)

- Communication with the memex via brain waves both as input and
  output.

Written in 1945. Wow!
