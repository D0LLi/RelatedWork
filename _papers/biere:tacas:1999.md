abstract: Symbolic Model Checking [3], [14] has proven to be a powerful technique for the verification of reactive systems. BDDs [2] have traditionally
  been used as a symbolic representation of the system. In this paper we show how boolean decision procedures, like St{\aa}lmarck's Method [16] or the Davis
  & Putnam Procedure [7], can replace BDDs. This new technique avoids the space blow up of BDDs, generates counterexamples much faster, and sometimes speeds
  up the verification. In addition, it produces counterexamples of minimal length. We introduce a bounded model checking procedure for LTL which reduces
  model checking to propositional satisfiability.We show that bounded LTL model checking can be done without a tableau construction. We have implemented
  a model checker BMC, based on bounded model checking, and preliminary results are presented.
