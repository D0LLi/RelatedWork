This 2009 [survey] of software [model checking] covers a lot of
ground from the roots in hardware model checking through to its
application to software.
A number of the key algorithms are described in pseudocode.

The sections give a good sense of what is covered

    > combining abstract interpretations for different
    > theories, analogous to the manner in which decision
    > procedures for different theories are combined.
