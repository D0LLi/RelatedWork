abstract: "In this paper, we present SeaHorn, a software verification framework. The
  key distinguishing feature of SeaHorn is its modular design that separates the concerns
  of the syntax of the programming language, its operational semantics, and the verification
  semantics. SeaHorn encompasses several novelties: it (a)\_encodes verification conditions
  using an efficient yet precise inter-procedural technique, (b)\_provides flexibility
  in the verification semantics to allow different levels of precision, (c)\_leverages
  the state-of-the-art in software model checking and abstract interpretation for
  verification, and (d)\_uses Horn-clauses as an intermediate language to represent
  verification conditions which simplifies interfacing with multiple verification
  tools based on Horn-clauses. SeaHorn provides users with a powerful verification
  tool and researchers with an extensible and customizable framework for experimenting
  with new software verification techniques. The effectiveness and scalability of
  SeaHorn are demonstrated by an extensive experimental evaluation using benchmarks
  from SV-COMP 2015 and real avionics code."
