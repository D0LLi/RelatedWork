abstract: Robustness and correctness are essential criteria for SAT and QBF solvers. We develop automated testing and debugging techniques designed and
  optimized for SAT and QBF solver development. Our fuzz testing techniques are able to find critical solver defects that lead to crashes, invalid satisfying
  assignments and incorrect satisfiability results. Moreover, we show that sequential and concurrent delta debugging techniques are highly effective in
  minimizing failure-inducing inputs.
