abstract: 'Carlsson and Hallgren describe the implementation of a set of "functional widgets" (Fudgets): components for programming graphical user interfaces
  under the X window system using the non-strict functional programming language Haskell. We describe an alternative implementation based on existing widget
  sets (currently Openlook and Motif). Our purpose is twofold: to show that the Fudgets approach can be applied to existing widget sets; and to discuss
  problems experienced with Fudgets during an industrial case study.'
