abstract: 'Separation logic is a program logic for reasoning about programs that manipulate
  pointer data structures. We describe Smallfoot, a tool for checking certain lightweight
  separation logic specifications. The assertions describe the shapes of data structures
  rather than their detailed contents, and this allows reasoning to be fully automatic.
  The presentation in the paper is tutorial in style. We illustrate what the tool
  can do via examples which are oriented toward novel aspects of separation logic,
  namely: avoidance of frame axioms (which say what a procedure does not change);
  embracement of \textasciigrave \textasciigrave dirty\textquotesingle \textquotesingle  features
  such as memory disposal and address arithmetic; information hiding in the presence
  of pointers; and modular reasoning about concurrent programs.'
