abstract: Counterexamples--execution traces of the system that illustrate how an error state can be reached from the initial state--are essential for understanding
  verification failures. They are one of the most salient features of Model Checkers, which distinguish them from Abstract Interpretation and other Static
  Analysis techniques by providing a user with information on how to debug their system and/or the specification. While in Hardware and Protocol verification,
  the counterexamples can be replayed in the system, in Software Model Checking (SMC) counterexamples take the form of a textual or semi-structured report.
  This is problematic since it complicates the debugging process by preventing developers from using existing processes and tools such as debuggers, fault
  localization, and fault minimization.
