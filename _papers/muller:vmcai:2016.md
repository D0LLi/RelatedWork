abstract: 'The automation of verification techniques based on first-order logic specifications
  has benefitted greatly from verification infrastructures such as Boogie and Why.
  These offer an intermediate language that can express diverse language features
  and verification techniques, as well as back-end tools: in particular, verification
  condition generators.'
