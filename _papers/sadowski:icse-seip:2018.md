Code review goes back to heavyweight practices in the '70s but this paper looks
at modern, lightweight review as practiced at Google since the early days.
Modern code review is

- informal
- tool-based
- asynchronous
- focused on reviewing code changes

Although finding bugs is important, much more important are

- normative effects: bringing consistency to the codebase
- educational effects: making sure that more than one person
  knows the code
- improving test quality
- accident prevention
- gatekeeping to protect other team's codebases

The paper highlights the importance of the relationship between the author of
a change and the reviewer. Several relationships can exist and affect the
expectations of the review.

- Project lead: education, maintaining norms
- New team members: education, maintaining norms
- Other team members: education, accident prevention
- Readability reviewers: maintaining norms
- Other teams: gatekeeping

Some distinctive features of Google's approach and tools (compared
with OSS, Microsoft and other review processes)

- the first review comments come fast
- changes are smaller
- often just one reviewer (most other processes have two)
- clearly defined expectations from review
- the tool recommends reviewer choice based on ownership,
  review load, availability, etc.
- integration of static analysis checks ([sadowski:cacm:2018])


One thing I did not understand about the paper was why they used
[snowball sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_sampling)
for the interviews they performed.
Wikipedia says that this is normally used for hidden populations
like drug addicts that are hard to identify but it is easy to generate
a list of reviewers, change authors, etc.
