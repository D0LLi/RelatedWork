Theoretical paper justifying the practice of adding auxiliary variables (ghost
state) to an implementation to enable refinement proof by providing
a completeness proof that a refinement mapping from an implementation S1 to
a specification S2 exists if S1 refines S2 and three conditions hold
- S1 is "machine closed",
- S2 has "finite invisible nondeterminism", and
- S2 is "internally continuous".

A refinement mapping is a function from the implementation state (including
auxiliary variables) to the specification state.
The auxiliary variables can be either "history variables" or "prophecy
variables".
