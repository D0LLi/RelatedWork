abstract: Separation logic is a popular specification language for imperative programs
  where the heap can only be mentioned through points-to assertions. However, separation
  logic's take on assertions does not match well with the classical view of assertions
  as boolean, side effect-free, potentially heap-dependent expressions from the host
  programming language familiar to many developers.
