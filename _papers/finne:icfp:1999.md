abstract: The increasing popularity of component-based programming tools offer a big opportunity to designers of advanced programming languages, such as
  Haskell. If we can package our programs as software components, then it is easy to integrate them into applications written in other languages.In earlier
  work we described a preliminary integration of Haskell with Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM), focusing on how Haskell can create and invoke COM
  objects. This paper develops that work, concentrating on the mechanisms that support externally-callable Haskell functions, and the encapsulation of Haskell
  programs as COM objects.
