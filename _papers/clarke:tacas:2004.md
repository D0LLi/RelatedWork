abstract: 'We present a tool for the formal verification of ANSI-C programs using Bounded Model Checking (BMC). The emphasis is on usability: the tool supports
  almost all ANSI-C language features, including pointer constructs, dynamic memory allocation, recursion, and the float and double data types. From the
  perspective of the user, the verification is highly automated: the only input required is the BMC bound. The tool is integrated into a graphical user
  interface. This is essential for presenting long counterexample traces: the tool allows stepping through the trace in the same way a debugger allows stepping
  through a program.'
