abstract: Formal methods are becoming an indispensable part of the design process in software and hardware industry. It takes robust tools and proofs to
  make formal validation of large scale projects reliable. In this paper, we will describe the current status of formal verification at Centaur Technology.
  We will explain our challenges and our methodology--how various proofs and verification artifacts are interconnected and how we keep them consistent over
  the duration of a project. We also describe our main engine--a powerful symbolic simulator with rewriting capabilities that is integrated in a theorem
  prover and proven correct.
