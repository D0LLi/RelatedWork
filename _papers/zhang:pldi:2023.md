abstract: We present egglog, a fixpoint reasoning system that unifies Datalog and equality saturation (EqSat). Like Datalog, egglog supports efficient incremental
  execution, cooperating analyses, and lattice-based reasoning. Like EqSat, egglog supports term rewriting, efficient congruence closure, and extraction
  of optimized terms. We identify two recent applications - a unification-based pointer analysis in Datalog and an EqSat-based floating-point term rewriter
  - that have been hampered by features missing from Datalog but found in EqSat or vice-versa. We evaluate our system by reimplementing those projects in
  egglog. The resulting systems in egglog are faster, simpler, and fix bugs found in the original systems.
