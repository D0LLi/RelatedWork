abstract:
  Rust is an emerging systems programming language with guaranteed
  memory safety and modern language features that has been extensively adopted to
  build safety-critical software. However, there is currently a lack of automated
  software verifiers for Rust. In this work, we present our experience extending
  the SMACK verifier to enable its usage on Rust programs. We evaluate SMACK on
  a set of Rust programs to demonstrate a wide spectrum of language features it
  supports.
