abstract: Pervasive formal verification of operating systems and hypervisors is, due to their safety-critical aspects, a highly relevant area of research.
  Many implementations consist of both assembler and C functions. Formal verification of their correctness must consider the correct interaction of code
  written in these languages, which is, in practice, ensured by using matching application binary interfaces (ABIs). Also, these programs must be able to
  interact with hardware. We present an integrated operational small-step semantics model of intermediate-language C and Macro-Assembler code execution
  for pervasive operating systems and hypervisor verification. Our semantics is based on a compiler calling convention that defines callee- and caller-save
  registers. We sketch a theory connecting this semantic layer with an ISA-model executing the compiled code for use in a pervasive verification context.
  This forms a basis for soundness proofs of tools used in the VerisoftXT project and is a crucial step towards arguing formal correctness of execution
  of the verified code on a gate-level hardware model.
