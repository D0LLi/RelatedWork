abstract: Mutation testing realizes the idea of using artificial defects to support testing activities. Mutation is typically used as a way to evaluate
  the adequacy of test suites, to guide the generation of test cases, and to support experimentation. Mutation has reached a maturity phase and gradually
  gains popularity both in academia and in industry. This chapter presents a survey of recent advances, over the past decade, related to the fundamental
  problems of mutation testing and sets out the challenges and open problems for the future development of the method. It also collects advices on best
  practices related to the use of mutation in empirical studies of software testing. Thus, giving the reader a "mini-handbook"-style roadmap for the application
  of mutation testing as experimental methodology.
