abstract: Mutation Testing is a fault-based software testing technique that has been widely studied for over three decades. The literature on Mutation Testing
  has contributed a set of approaches, tools, developments, and empirical results. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and survey of Mutation Testing.
  The paper also presents the results of several development trend analyses. These analyses provide evidence that Mutation Testing techniques and tools
  are reaching a state of maturity and applicability, while the topic of Mutation Testing itself is the subject of increasing interest.
