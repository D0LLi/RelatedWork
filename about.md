This site contains [short summaries of papers]({{ "../papers" }})
related to what I am working on or that I am thinking about.

The goal is to create [mini summaries of research topics]({{"../topics"}})
in different areas.
These will not be _surveys_: I don't aim to make them comprehensive
and they will certainly be skewed by whatever my interest
in a field may be and flawed by the fact that I will typically an
outsider/newcomer to the field struggling to make sense of what I am reading
and to find the important papers in a sea of publications.

The summaries of papers will usually be brief and based on a single quick
skim of the paper.
If you are an author and feel that I misunderstood your paper,
I am happy (eager!) to correct details if you want to get in touch.

The tooling around this site is pretty simple at the moment: I have repurposed
the Jekyll material from my website (which is based on
[Barry Clark's Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now))
and I have a Python script that converts BibTeX entries to page templates.
But ideally this would be much more integrated with one or more of the main
research search engines like Google Scholar â€“ perhaps as some form of overlay over
the basic website.
